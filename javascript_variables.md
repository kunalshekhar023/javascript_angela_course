- variables are containers that contain data.

Eg.
var Myname= "kunal";
here `var` is a keyword which tells the browser that Myname is a variable.
Myname is the name of the container were we have stored the string "kunal".
this value can be used later in the code.
its value can be changed.
`var` only needs to used once while initializing the variable.

# Rules for naming a variable.(best practices)

- you cannot name your variables using a keyword.Eg variable name cannot be var --> rule
- variable name cannot start with number --> rule
- varaible name cannot contain spaces. --> rule
